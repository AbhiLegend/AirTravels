# AirTravels
<br>Code Challenge </br>
<br>The given code is a Python script that uses several data science and machine learning libraries to cluster cities based on their internet users, road length, and railway route length. It then finds the best cluster for new air travel routes, visualizes the best cluster and its centroid in 3D, and identifies the cities closest to the centroid.

The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, Plotly Express, and more. It then loads the data from a CSV file named "data_cities.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame and removes the non-numeric columns. The data is then standardized using Scikit-Learn's StandardScaler.

Next, the script prompts the user to select the number of clusters to use for the KMeans algorithm using a slider widget. It then fits a KMeans model to the standardized data with the selected number of clusters and adds cluster labels to the original DataFrame. The silhouette score is calculated using Scikit-Learn's silhouette_score function and is displayed using Streamlit.

The script then visualizes the results in 3D using Plotly Express, with the x, y, and z axes representing internet users, road length, and railway route length, respectively, and the colors representing the different clusters. It also displays a list of clusters with their statistics.

The script then finds the best cluster for new air travel routes by calculating the distances between the centroids and the data points using Scikit-Learn's transform function and selecting the closest cluster. It visualizes the best cluster and its centroid in 3D using Plotly Express and calculates the centroid's coordinates.

Finally, the script finds the cities closest to the centroid using Scikit-Learn's NearestNeighbors and displays them using Streamlit.</br>

<br>Overall, this script demonstrates how to use several powerful libraries to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks, including data loading, cleaning, standardization, clustering, visualization, and more.

<br>What is the project doing elaborate</br>
<br>This project is performing a clustering analysis on a dataset of cities to identify groups of cities that share similar characteristics based on three features: the number of internet users, the length of roadways, and the length of railway routes.

The project uses the KMeans clustering algorithm to identify these groups of cities. It first loads the dataset and standardizes the data to ensure that each feature is on the same scale. It then uses the streamlit library to allow the user to select the number of clusters to create. Once the user selects a number of clusters, the algorithm uses KMeans to cluster the cities and assigns each city to a cluster.

The project then calculates the silhouette score, a measure of how well the clustering algorithm performed. A higher silhouette score indicates that the clustering algorithm created well-defined clusters that are well-separated from each other.

The project uses Plotly to create a 3D scatter plot of the cities, with each point colored based on the cluster it belongs to. It also displays a summary of each cluster's characteristics, such as the mean and standard deviation of each feature.

The project then finds the closest cluster to a new air travel route by calculating the distance between the air travel route and the centroids of each cluster. It then displays a 3D scatter plot of the cities in the closest cluster and calculates the centroid of that cluster. Finally, it uses the NearestNeighbors algorithm to find the five cities closest to the centroid of the closest cluster.

<br>How are we doing Identification of new air travel routes in emerging markets our solution as proposed by anove code </br>
<br>The solution proposed by the above code uses clustering techniques to identify groups of cities with similar characteristics in terms of internet users, road length, and railway route length. It then suggests the best cluster for new air travel routes based on the proximity of cities to the centroid of the identified cluster.

The code first loads the data from a CSV file using Pandas, and then removes non-numeric columns and standardizes the remaining data using StandardScaler from Scikit-learn. It then allows the user to interactively select the number of clusters for KMeans clustering using a slider in the Streamlit app.

After fitting the KMeans model on the standardized data, it adds the cluster labels to the original DataFrame and computes the Silhouette score to evaluate the quality of the clustering. It then visualizes the results using a 3D scatter plot created with Plotly, with each data point colored according to its assigned cluster.

Next, the code shows a list of clusters with details using the describe() function of the Pandas DataFrame. It then identifies the best cluster for new air travel routes by finding the closest cluster to the centroid of the standardized data using the transform() method of the KMeans object.

It then visualizes the best cluster in 3D and calculates the centroid of the best cluster using KMeans cluster_centers_ attribute. Finally, it finds the cities closest to the centroid of the best cluster using NearestNeighbors from Scikit-learn and displays the result in the Streamlit app.
